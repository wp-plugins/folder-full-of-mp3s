Underscores in your file names will be replaced by spaces to make them read nicely. So "Artist_name-name_of_track.mp3" will display as "Artist name-name of track".

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `folder-full-of-mp3s` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress. `Folder full of MP3s` now appears in your widgets. 
3. Create a folder for your MP3's on your server. For example, in the same folder as your index.php (the root of your wordpress installation), create a folder call `sound`. Upload some MP3's to the folder.
4. Drag the `Folder full of MP3s` widget to your sidebar, and configure it - give it a title, and tell it where your folder of MP3's is. If your folder is not in your web root then you need to include the path from your webroot. (For example, if you have your wordpress installed in a folder called `blog`, and you created a folder called `mp3s` in `blog`, then enter your folder as `blog/mp3s`).
